I finished reading "The catcher in the rhy" yesterday. I don't think this is an excellent book. The main character in this book just hates everything. I have no idea why he thinks in this way, though he is only 12 years old. Anyway, he is more mature than me when I was 12 years old, absolutely.

I used to read English books in order to improve my English and enlarge my vocabulary. But I think that's not important now. I mean, learning English is not that important. So why am I still reading these books? Maybe reading books in Chinese will be faster. Honestly I don't know. I still hope reading in English constantly will help me in the future sometime.
