I installed *bittorrent sync* tonight, one on my PC and one on my digitalocean VPS. If it's working correctly, the previous [backup script](/2015/12/27/backup-script/) would be useless.

One of the possible issues might be the storage limitation of my VPS, which is only 20GB by now. I haven't checked how much storage the synced files take, but I guess it's not a lot by now, though it will grow.

Another problem is the huge amount of git files to sync. These files are of little use on account of the *archive* feature of *bittorrent sync*. But anyway, I will see if it's working correctly and smoothly without doing any changes to it.
