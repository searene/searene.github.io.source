I feel pretty bad recently, and it occurred to me that what made me feel bad was not the world, it was me, myself. I have to do something to fill my brain with energy, so I add a new task today, to program for my own project for at least 3 hours, apart from other coding and stuff.

Though I program almost every day, I never set a goal for myself. This is really a problem, sometimes I'm just being lazy, which puts my project off again and again. So I decided to put an end to this bad behavior. There's one thing that could achieve it, which is set a goal, a task, forcing myself to finish it every day.

I reduced my running distance from 4km to 2km, because I figured that 4km is too much for me. I didn't run in a very long time, I have to do it, it's a very efficient way to keep me being energetic.

This is my everyday task list

```
ID Age  Recur Due Description                             Urg 
 8 2min   P1D 10h run for 2km                              8.6
11 24s    P1D 10h review the words in anki                 8.6
12 24s    P1D 10h add 20 new words to anki                 8.6
 5 2min   P1D 11h play the guitar for at least 30 minutes 8.58
 6 2min   P1D 11h read 5% of the book in my kindle        8.58
14 -      P1D 11h program for my project                  8.58

6 tasks
```

It would take about 20 + 15 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 180 = 305min â‰ˆ 5 hours, A lot to be done every day, I will see if I can finish all of them.

Then I thought about another thing. Though I created a task to program for at least 3 hours every day, I should have a goal for each hour. I made a list of what I should do about the project right now. Once I finish one of them, I check it.

1. ~~Rename deck~~
2. ~~Delete deck~~
3. ~~Add word~~
4. The click event of *show answer* button in review page
5. The whole front-end of the review page
6. Time schedule for *Again*, *Hard*, *Good*, *Easy*

There are only these goals for now, I will add a new list if I finish all of them on the above list.

**What I want ultimately is the sense of felicity, from the bottom of my heart.**
