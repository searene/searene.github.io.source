I arrived in Hangzhou yesterday, and I could feel that the amounts of dopamine released in my brain fluctuated from time to time. At first I felt really happy, I was not sure why. Then I felt sort of upset when I got off the plane and headed towards my company. Maybe it was because I had to work again in my company, which was so boring and annoying. I think some people tend to release dopamine a lot, and they may never know what depression is like.

I downloaded the movie `Passenger` from the Internet and watched it last night. To my suprise, although there were lots of negative comments on `douban`, I found the movie pretty interesting and compelling. Maybe it was due to the unbeatable charm of `Jennifer Lawrence`, she was so beautiful. That being said, the plot was not bad, and the film's special effects were amazing! I really loved it. I even loved it to the extent that I couldn't decide whether `Arrival` or `Passenger` was better, even though the former got a much higher mark on `douban` and `IMDB`.

Another thing. I decided to use `Wechat` as few as possible. I watched a Ted talk yesterday and the speaker said that falling into social media was really a bad thing for us. It might cause more anxiety and depression and made us even more lonely, no matter how many friends we had ONLINE. I think that is absolutely correct. I felt more lonely when I talked in social media, our brain wasn't designed to talk like this. We have to communicate face to face, use our gestures and expressions to create a better conversation and relax ourselves. Really, few people care about what I post on moments, what is the purpose of that!
