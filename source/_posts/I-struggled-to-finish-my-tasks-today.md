Today I was in a pretty bad mood, but I still finished my tasks. Because I know, whether I'm in a good or bad mood, I have to live any way. And if I do nothing, things would become worse. In fact, if I immersed myself in doing anything at all, I would probably focuse in that stuff, and forget about other things, including my trouble. So concentrating is pretty good for me. I need to learn to concentrate in any circumstances.
