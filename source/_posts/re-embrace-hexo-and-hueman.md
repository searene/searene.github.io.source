About a month ago, I started writing blogs in Chinese using WordPress. I stuck to the plan for about several days then decided to use English instead. The reason is unbelievably simple: typing English characters is a lot easier than typing Chinese characters.

Now today, which is about a month later, I decided to abandon WordPress altogether. WordPress is an excellent blogging platform, I have to admit it. But I cannot find a reliable way to use markdown in WordPress, and I also noticed some odd behaviors of the visual editor used in WordPress. Nothing is more convenient and portable than writing my blogs in vim using markdown. So finally I decided to abandon it and embrace hexo and hueman again.

I will consider moving some of the blogs written in WordPress back in here.
