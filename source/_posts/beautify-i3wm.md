# Motivation
I enjoy using i3wm, big time. You can switch to different windows/apps conveniently with it. The only problem to me is that it's not beautiful enough, and it's ridiculously small in my high-resolution screen. So I decided to change it a little bit.

# Effect
Here is what you would get after applying the method.

# Method
To change the appearance, you only need to modify the config file, usually it's `~/.config/i3/config`. Add the following lines.

```
font pango:nimbus sans 18
bar {
  status_command conky -c $HOME/.i3/conky/conkyrc
  mode dock
  position top
  strip_workspace_numbers yes
  colors {
    background #F1F2F6
    statusline #788491
    separator #51c4d4

    focused_workspace  #F1F2F6 #F1F2F6 #4FC0E8
    active_workspace   #F1F2F6 #F1F2F6 #4FC0E8
    inactive_workspace #F1F2F6 #F1F2F6 #C1D1E0
    urgent_workspace   #F1F2F6 #F1F2F6 #C1D1E0
  }
}
```

Remove those lines.

```
font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 10 (Or whatever the font is)
bar {
        status_command i3status
}
```

Then install `conky` and `font-awesome`, create a new file `~/.i3/conky/conkyrc`, put the following lines in it.

```

Restart i3, the shortcut of mine is `Shift+$mod+r`, `$mod` could either be `Alt` or `Super key`.

Note that if spaces are not recognized, install `awesome-terminal-fonts` and restart.

```
pacaur -S awesome-terminal-fonts
```
