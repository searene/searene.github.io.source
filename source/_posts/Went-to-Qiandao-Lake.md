Qingming Festival of 2018 falls on April 5 to April 7 in China, and I, along with two of my college classmates, planed to go to Qiandao Lake for two days.

Qiandao Lake is about 150km away from my house, we started at about 10:00 AM, and arrived at around 2:30 PM. All of us were exhausted, after having our lunch at a local restaurant, we all went to sleep. In fact, we did almost nothing but driving/watching TV on the first day.

When the second day came, we decided to go around by boat and have some fun. The boat was bigger than I thought, which might be able to hold around 100 people.

There were even bigger ones, which looked like a building.

I found that the scenery was not bad, maybe slightly better than I thought. This is small island.

On our way back, we were hit by another car in the highway. This was intense. Luckily no one got hurt. We didn't finish dealing with the accident until 8 o'clock, during which we called the police and the insurance company. Since we were the one that got hit, we didn't need to assume any responsibility. And for the other car, all the money was covered by the insurance company, so no one needed to worry about that.

Then we drove to my company and had a supper around it, it was about 9 o'clock at that time. We were all pretty tired. We went to our home respectively and the travel was over.
